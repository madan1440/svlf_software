This repository now includes a static GitHub Pages build that reads from `full.csv` and `emi.csv`.

## GitHub Pages hosting
1. Commit your latest `full.csv` and `emi.csv` data.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Set the source to the `main` branch (or the branch you publish) and the root folder.
4. Save, then wait for the Pages URL to become available.

The app will load data directly from the CSV files in the repo using `assets/app.js`.
